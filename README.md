1.) Booking Pattern Analysis: Understand the booking patterns, including confirmed and canceled bookings, to identify trends and anomalies. Analyze how the pandemic has affected booking behaviors, such as changes in booking dates and cancellations.

2.)Revenue Analysis: Calculate and visualize the total revenue generated by each squad, considering bookings from various dates, including those for future months. Calculate and visualize the revenue generated specifically for the current month to understand the immediate financial situation. Room Nights and Cancellation Analysis:

3.) Determine the number of room nights booked by each squad on a daily basis. Calculate the number of booking nights that have been canceled and the corresponding revenue loss.

4.) Monthly Performance: Calculate the total revenue and room nights created by each squad for the current month. Assess the performance of each squad in terms of revenue generation and room night bookings.

5.) Squad-Level Insights: Provide squad-level insights into booking patterns, revenue, and cancellations. Highlight the squads that are performing well or facing challenges.

6.) Data Integration: Utilize data from multiple datasets, including booking data, squad mapping, property details, and ID mapping, to provide comprehensive insights.

7.) Visualization Dashboard: Create a user-friendly visualization dashboard that presents key metrics, trends, and insights. Enable upper management to interact with the data visually and explore important aspects of the business.

8.) Revenue Target Alignment: Compare the revenue generated by each squad against their targeted revenue (provided in the property details dataset). Identify squads that are meeting or falling short of their revenue targets.

By addressing these challenges and objectives, the project aims to empower small to medium business owners in the hospitality industry with actionable insights. The resulting dashboard and reporting will enable them to make critical decisions to navigate the challenging business environment and strive for sustainability and growth.
